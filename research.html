        <h1>Research on Data Collection</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Background Information</h2>
            <p>Data collection means gathering information about people or their activities. Online, this happens whenever you use websites, apps, or other services. Companies collect data to understand what people like, make their services better, and sometimes sell the data to advertisers. For example, if you search for shoes on Google, it might show you ads for shoes later.
                In the past, businesses used surveys or asked questions to collect data. Now, with new technology, they can collect huge amounts of information quickly. Websites, phones, and smart devices like Alexa or Google Home are some of the tools used for collecting data today.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Current Evidence</h2>
            <p>Today, data collection is happening almost everywhere online. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram track what you like, share, or comment on. Shopping websites like Amazon track what you search for and what you buy. Even free apps often collect things like your location or the contacts in your phone.

                Some examples include:
                
                Cookies: These are small files saved on your computer when you visit a website. They help websites remember things you do, like what you search for or what items you add to a cart.
                Mobile Apps: Many apps ask for permissions to see your location, photos, or messages, even if they don’t need them to work.
                Smart Devices: Devices like Alexa and Google Home listen to your voice. Sometimes, they record your voice to improve how they work.</p>

            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>Data collection has benefits. It helps companies improve their services and gives users things like better recommendations on Netflix or Spotify. However, it can also be dangerous. If too much personal information is collected or not stored safely, hackers can steal it. In the past few years, data breaches have exposed private information of billions of people.

                Another problem is fairness. Many people don’t know how much data is collected or how it’s used. To solve this, governments have created rules like GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California to protect people’s privacy and give them more control over their data.
                
                In short, data collection can be helpful, but it also creates risks. People need to be aware of how their data is collected and take steps to protect their privacy.</p>
