            <li>Why I chose this topic</li>
            <p>I picked data collection because it is a big part of our online lives. Every time we visit a website or use an app, our data is being collected. This includes what we search for, where we go, and even what we buy. I wanted to learn more about how this happens, why companies do it, and how it affects us.
            </p>
            <li>What I learned</li>
            <p>I learned that companies collect a lot of data without us noticing. For example, cookies on websites track what we click on and save our preferences. Apps also ask for access to things like our location or photos, even when it is not needed.
                I also found out how risky data collection can be. If companies do not protect our information, hackers can steal it. This has happened many times, with millions of people’s personal data exposed.
                Another thing I learned is how data is used for ads. If you search for a product, you will see ads for it everywhere. While this can be helpful, it also feels like companies know too much about us.
            </p>
            <li>How It Changed Me</li>
            <p>Before, I did not care much about my online privacy. I accepted all cookies and gave apps full access. Now, I am more careful. I say “no” to cookies when I can and check app permissions. I also use ad blockers and privacy-friendly browsers like DuckDuckGo.</p>
            <li>Why it Matters</li>
            <p>Data collection affects everyone. Companies use our data in ways we do not always understand. By being careful, we can protect our privacy and control our personal information better.It’s crucial to educate others about how their data is being used and how they can protect themselves in a digitally-driven world.</p>
