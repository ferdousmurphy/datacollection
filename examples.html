        <h1>Examples of Data Collection</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Cambridge Analytica:</strong> Misuse of Facebook data to influence elections.</li>
            <p>Social Media - Facebook and Cambridge Analytica
                One of the most famous examples of data collection misuse is the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. In 2018, it was revealed that a company called Cambridge Analytica collected data from millions of Facebook users without their permission. This data was used to create ads and messages to influence political decisions, like the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. This example shows how personal data can be used in ways people might not expect or agree with.</p>
            <li><strong>Google Location Tracking:</strong> Continuous user tracking through mobile apps.</li>
            <p><li><strong>Smart Devices - Alexa and Google Home:</strong>
                Devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home are very convenient. You can use them to play music, check the weather, or control smart home devices. However, they are always listening for commands. Sometimes, these devices accidentally record conversations and send the recordings to the company for review. This raises concerns about privacy, especially when the data is stored or shared without the userâ€™s full understanding.
                </p>
            <p><li><strong>Online Shopping - Amazon</strong></li>
                Amazon collects a lot of data about its users. Every time you browse for a product, add something to your cart, or make a purchase, Amazon records it. It uses this information to recommend products you might like. For example, if you search for fitness equipment, Amazon might show you ads for running shoes or gym gear. While this can be helpful, it also shows how much companies know about your interests and habits.</p>
            <li><strong>Amazon Echo:</strong> Collecting voice data for improving AI but raising privacy concerns.</li>
